        <h2>Common DXVK Errors</h2>
        <p>Below are some of the most common errors users may face while using DXVK:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> Slow frame rates or stuttering gameplay.</li>
            <li><strong>Missing Files:</strong> Game fails to launch due to missing Direct3D files.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphical Glitches:</strong> Artifacts or distortion in graphics.</li>
            <li><strong>Crashes:</strong> Game crashes upon launching or during gameplay.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Troubleshoot and Fix Errors</h2>

        <h3>1. Check Your System Requirements</h3>
        <p>Ensure that your system meets the necessary requirements to run DXVK. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A compatible Linux distribution.</li>
            <li>Latest Vulkan drivers.</li>
            <li>Wine configured correctly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your system does not meet these requirements, you may encounter errors. Upgrade your drivers or Wine version if necessary.</p>

        <h3>2. Update DXVK</h3>
        <p>Always make sure you're using the latest version of DXVK. You can check for updates on the official DXVK website: <a href="https://dxvk-download.github.io">dxvk-download.github.io</a>. Follow the steps outlined in the <a href="dxvk-installation-guide.html">DXVK installation guide</a> to update.</p>

        <h3>3. Configure Wine Settings</h3>
        <p>Improper Wine settings can lead to errors with DXVK. Consider the following adjustments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the correct Windows version is selected in Wine (e.g., Windows 10).</li>
            <li>Enable "Use WineD3D" for compatibility with certain games.</li>
            <li>Adjust the graphics settings within Wine, such as enabling virtual desktop mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To access these settings, run the Wine configuration tool:</p>
        <pre><code>winecfg</code></pre>

        <h3>4. Install Missing Dependencies</h3>
        <p>Some games require additional libraries to function correctly. Use the following commands to install common dependencies:</p>
        <pre><code>sudo apt-get install vkd3d</code></pre>
        <pre><code>sudo apt-get install wine64</code></pre>
        <p>Check the gameâ€™s documentation for any specific requirements.</p>

        <h3>5. Tweak Game Settings</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, the issue may lie within the game's own settings. Try the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower the graphics settings to see if performance improves.</li>
            <li>Disable any in-game overlays (like Steam overlay) that could interfere with DXVK.</li>
            <li>Run the game in windowed mode to check if it resolves any crashing issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Use DXVK Logs for Debugging</h3>
        <p>DXVK provides logging features that can help identify errors. Enable logging by setting the following environment variable in your terminal before launching the game:</p>
        <pre><code>WINEDEBUG=+d3d11,+dxvk wine your_game.exe</code></pre>
        <p>This will produce logs that you can analyze to understand what might be going wrong. Review the logs for error messages or warnings that can guide your troubleshooting efforts.</p>

        <h3>7. Community Support and Resources</h3>
        <p>If you're still facing issues, consider reaching out to the community for support. You can find help on:</p>
